# Notice

This folder contains survey papers we used from arixv, and cited papers of them are extracted with title and abstract for retrieval and generation.

**survey_info.txt**: the first col is the arixv id and second col is the title of the survey.



Some surveys may be documented in survey_info.txt, but have no corresponding figures because the bib or bbl files cannot be extracted.
